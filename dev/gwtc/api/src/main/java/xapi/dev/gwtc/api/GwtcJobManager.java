/**
 * This class is the successor to the previously fragmented {@link GwtcService} and {@link GwtcJobState} and {@link com.google.gwt.dev.codeserver.RecompileRunner}.
 *
 * The purpose of this class is to receive compile requests from a {@link GwtManifest} parameter,
 * generate the correct files and classpath, instantiate a runtime environment (classloader or process),
 * then monitor that environment for status and/or send it instructions / requests.
 *
 * This allows us to keep multiple compilations alive and servicing requests,
 * with guarantees about classpath (and ugly static var) isolation.
 *
 * The Gwt compiler leaks some static state, so running more than one
 * compilation on a shared classloader with different dependencies is an unsupported configuration.
 *
 * That is to say, it will probably work, most of the time... So you should still prefer an isolated classloader
 * (no shared parent / different static universe), or running as a separate process entirely
 * (necessary if using google's hack for getting java 9 classpaths: reading System.getProperty("java.class.path")).
 *
 * Users of XApi fork + Java 9 should be able to avoid this by properly specifying open modules,
 * either by creating modules opened to the gwt module, or by passing flags to jvm to allow reading classloaders.
 *
 * Users of java 8 have nothing to worry about. :-)
