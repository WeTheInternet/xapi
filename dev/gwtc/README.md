This module is a parent for the gwt compiler api, and a number of gui implementations.

The core module is an event-based wrapper around gwt compile events,  
as well as a set of UI controller interfaces which must be implemented.

Frontends for gwt and jre are provided, which will replace the compilers used in maven and collide.
