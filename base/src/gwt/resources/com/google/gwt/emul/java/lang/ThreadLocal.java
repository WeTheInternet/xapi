 *
 * This will allow pure java clients to enable multithreading,
 * so all core code will be threadsafe when html5 web workers can support using compiled gwt.
 *
 * For optimal efficiency, this will likely require compiling multiple independant gwt modules
 * which simply export a common javascript api to communicate across windows.
 *
 * Due to web workers not sharing memory space or objects access across multiple threads,
 * each ThreadLocal instance will still be nothing more than a singleton bean wrapper.
