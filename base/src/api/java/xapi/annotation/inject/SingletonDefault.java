 * Used to link a singleton implementation class to an injectable interface.

 *
 * There should only ever be one @DefaulImpl per service interface;

 *
 * <br/>
 *
 * static interface MyService{}
 *
 * <br/>
 *
 * <pre>@SingletonDefault(implFor=MyService.class)</pre>
 * static class MyServiceImpl implements MyService{}
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * //returns a singleton instance of MyServiceImpl
 * <br/>
 * MyService service = X_Inject.singleton(MyService.class);
