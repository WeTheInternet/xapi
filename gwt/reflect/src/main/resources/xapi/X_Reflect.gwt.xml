<!-- 
  Due to the generator's need to see a class literal in order to get type data during the UnifyAST phase,
  it becomes impossible to use Class object references in your app,
  which can be handy, since you may not want to / be able to reference the class literal reference.
  
  There is an experimental workaround in progress which will allow you to store state during UnifyAST,
  and then receive a notification to generate code after each split point, and when the app is fully compiled.
  This workaround exposes a method, X_Inject.magicClass(Class) Class; that remembers the class literal,
  returns a Class object with extended Class emulation, and allows you to pass object references into injector code.
  
  Once a class has passed through X_Inject.magicClass(Class), you do not need to keep the reference to the returned class,
  the generator will be exporting code that uses the class object you provide, and we make our mappings with the 
  original class literal (so calling X_Inject.instance(clone.getClass()) will work, if it's class literal has been seen before).

  A MagicClass actually extends java.lang.Class (not allowed in jre!),
  and it exposes as much or as little functionality as you please, (see the @MagicClass annotation).
  Classes without @MagicClass will not add emulation support for class methods like getPackage() or getAnnotation(),
  but will still be functional in injector methods (and anywhere else tying into the MagicClass framework).

  
  
  In the generator runtime, it remembers ALL class literals you have sent through it,
  and will generate a singleton which maps class literal objects to MagicClass singletons.
  This allows other magic method services to receive MagicClass instances instead of class literals,
  provided they generate a method call which treats the class like a map key;
  
  To facilitate this end, our MagicClassInjector exposes a method, getClassesSeen() which returns 
  all class literals it has seen during generation; in order to generate a handler with the complete list of classes,
  when we have to return generated AST, we need to make a reference to a method we haven't generated yet.
  
  It is up to the implementor to decide how to build support for using MagicClasses incrementally,
  but a default implementation is provided in the injection utilities, 
  which calls MagicClassInjector.getClassesSeen() and generates support for any types not yet seen.
  It has an internal plugin service to map from runtime Class object to an instantiator object,
  and it adds support incrementally
  
  The MagicContext object sent to magic method generators accepts callbacks, OnUnifyASTFinished,
  which will be called after the entire app has been compiled.
  You will then be able to iterate any state you stored during the app visit,
  have all class literals (or method calls or whatever you collect) in memory,
