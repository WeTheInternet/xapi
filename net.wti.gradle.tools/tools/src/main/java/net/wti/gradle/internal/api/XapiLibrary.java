/**
 * A XapiLibrary represents an entire project's groups of archives.
 *
 * The library itself is a {@link XapiVariant} representing the main sourceset.
 * It can also contain platform-specific variants, {@link XapiPlatform}s, which are themselves XapiVariants.
 *
 * Each XapiVariant has a default "main" archive, plus optional api, spi and stub archives,
 * source jars, and (eventually) automatic test sourcesets added and wired up sanely.
 *
 * For simple cases, you have no platform-specific implementation code at all,
 * and you just add code to src/main/java, src/api/java like normal.
 *
 * For more complex cases, where you have implementations which export api and spi jars,
 * you would add code to, say:
 * src/main/java
 * src/api/java
 * src/spi/java
 * src/gwt/main/java
 * src/gwt/api/java
 * src/gwt/test/java
 *
 * All transitive dependencies will be automatically wired up for you;
 * all mains will automatically inherit api, while all implementation mains (platforms)
 * will, by default (if no explicit dependencies added) inherit main, api AND spi,
 * as it's presumed that your platform-native code is implementing the spi and glue for the api to work.

     * Where -Pxapi.prefix controls the root variant name ($prefix), which is the suffix for all child variants.
     * These will match the per-platform artifact naming convention, so it would be perfectly reasonable to have
     * the following sets of published jars:
     *
     * xapi-thing.jar -> XapiLibrary's default dependency, uses main sourceset.
     * xapi-thing-source.jar -> The main sourceset's source jar
     * xapi-thing-api.jar -> api jar, transitive compile-scoped inherited by the main sourceset.
     * xapi-thing-spi.jar -> spi jar, transitive runtime-scoped inherited by the main sourceset.
     * xapi-gwt-thing.jar -> Uses gwt sourceset, provides / depends on everything needed to "use in gwt"
     * xapi-gwt-thing-api.jar -> Gwt-only transitive compile-scoped inherited by the gwt source sourceset.
     *
     *
     * In most cases, `gwt-thing` would inherit and implement `thing-spi`,
     * whereas `gwt-otherthing` would inherit `gwt-thing-api` if it only needs the public API.
