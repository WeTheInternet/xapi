/**
 * A lambda-able "only usable as a consumer" wrapper around a gradle {@link Configuration}.
 *
 * This lets us put our common consumer-based logic in one place,
 * and encourages a safer / subject-oriented API.
 *
 * If these ABIs breaks on upgrades,
 * it is likely because of an underlying change in foreign behavior;
 * that is, it's good to force you fix how you use this interface,
 * instead of slowly, silently failing because we didn't want to bother you.
