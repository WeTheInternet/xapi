 * implementors to decide how to service request, so we can focus only
 * on what to service).

     * This is called before a XapiServer server is started

     *
     * Currently, at least in tests, our server is being created from an empty WebApp,
     * and then we install routes and endpoints, then start the server.
     * As such, we need to either ensure all servers tolerate mutation,
     * or we need to enforce cleaner timing semantics.

     * @param app - A {@link WebApp} model for you to mutate
     * @return a callback to peek at the server after it is created,
     * but before it is started.
     *
     * If you need to install endpoints to a server instance,
     * it would look like this:
     * <pre>
     * In1<XapiServer<?,?>> installToServer(WebApp app) {
     *     app.getRoute().add(myRoute("/myPath"));
     *     return server->{
     *        server.registerEndpoint("
     *     }
     * }
     * </pre>
