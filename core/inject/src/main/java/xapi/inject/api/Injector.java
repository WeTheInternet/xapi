/**
 * A simple injection interface used for java-based dependency injection.
 *
 * This interface is used to separate gwt-dev mode from pure java.
 *
 * Gwt-based injection uses magic methods and generated classes,
 * because each injected service requires a specific method as a provider.
 * In order for code splitting to work, we cannot reference all provider
 * classes in a single method.  For regular JRE implementations, however,
 * it is perfectly fine to access whatever class we want whenever we want.

public interface Injector {


  /**
   * Synchronously returns a singleton which implements or extends this method's generic type.
   *
   * For gwt-dev mode, this class is generated from the annotations
   * {@link SingletonDefault} and {@link SingletonOverride}
   *
   * For java mode, the {@link JavaInjector} uses runtime lookup of resources in
   * META-INF/singletons or META-INF/singletons to find bindings for your classes.
   *
   * If you enable runtime injection, the tool will do a once-per-runtime scan for annotations,
   * and will generate the bindings in memory.  For maximum performance in
   * production, you will want to use the preloading strategy to read in a
   * manifest of all injectable classes and prepare providers before they are
   * requested.
   *
   * A maven plugin will be provided to create this manifest for you.
   *
   * All libraries exporting functionality should include specific META-INF
   * bindings for defaults at least; the META-INF resources will only be checked
   * if the given type is not already bound.
   *
   * @param cls - The service interface or base service class to provide
   * @return - A singleton instance of the service class.
