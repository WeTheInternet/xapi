/**
 * A static accessor class for in an instance of {@link Injector}.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * Classes marked with {@link SingletonDefault} or {@link SingletonOverride} are usable by X_Inject.
 * Once a class has been marked as a service provider for a given interface or class,
 * it can be used in cross-platform code as follows:
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * static interface MyService{}
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * <pre>@SingletonDefault(implFor=MyService.class)</pre>
 * static class MyServiceImpl implements MyService{}
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * MyService service = X_Inject.singleton(MyService.class);//returns MyServiceImpl
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * All actual injection occurs in implementations of {@link Injector}.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * The pure-java solution uses {@link JavaInjector}, which is based on the
 * jre6 {@link ServiceLoader}, with some tweaks to match the gwt injector behavior.
 * Files with the name equal to the interface or class being injected are written
 * to META-INF/singletons for services to be instantiated only once per runtime.
 * META-INF/instances is for objects that should be new copies for every request.
 *
 * A third form as META-INF/threadlocal may be provided for thread-local or
 * process-local services, to help separated code share state without explicit
 * reference passing.  This option will be considered if the concurrency model
 * is able to offer lifecycle events to ensure the gc of process-local singletons.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * Unlike ServiceLoader, which presents an iterable of available services,
 * X_Inject currently only returns the highest priority (top of the list) service,
 * and it only returns lazily-loaded singletons (which work with code splitting).
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * Note, all static service accessors in XApi are prefixed with X_,
 * to make exposed services easier to discover in autocomplete.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
