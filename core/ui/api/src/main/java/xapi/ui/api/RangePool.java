/**
 * The RangePool class is used to store a set of {@link Coord}s,
 * used as ranges, where X and Y are used to denote
 * a pair of start/end points along the same dimension
 * (X and Y are named points, not the names of intersecting dimensions).
 *
 *
 * That is, this class represents a +Infinity to -Infinity range of space,
 * which can then be reserved by calling code in an efficient manner.
 *
 * The internal structure of this collection is a linked list
 * of reserved and unreserved spaces (for visualization purposes,
 * think of reserved space in red, and unreserved in green).
 *
 * We start with a single node of unreserved space from +Infinity to -Infinity.
 * To request a range to reserve, calling code sends a Coord,
 * and we check if that space is reserved or not;
 * if not, we reserve that space by splitting the unreserved node,
 * and splicing in a reserved space to take its place.
 *
 * Then, we will want to update our min/max reserved point pointers
 * (yes, point pointers. We are using points, and storing pointers to them),
 * so we can efficiently handle any reservation request that is closer to
 * infinity in either direction than any reserved point.
 *
 * Any reservation requests made within that range
 * should be smart enough to search from the nearest point possible.
 *
 * Imagine we have the following spaces (for unreserved), [for reserved]:
 *
 *  (-Infinity, -1)
 *  [-1, 0]
 *  (0, 1)
 *  [1, 3]
 *  (3, 5)
 *  [5, 9]
 *  (9, +Infinity)
 *
 *  This pool has three reserved spaces, with some space in between them.
 *  There are 7 nodes in total (2n + 1).  By storing the highest and lowest point,
 *  we can quickly handle any requests beyond either edge (outside -1 to +9 is easy).
 *  However, when we want to insert something in the middle, we will need
 *  a heuristic that can be fast at finding the best insertion point quickly.
 *
 *  To do this, we will need a way to find a middle point in the linked list;
 *  rather than pay a lot to continually update binary search pointers,
 *  we can instead also store a linked list based on insertion order,
 *  so that when seeking a starting point, we can consider min, max, head and tail.
 *
 *  Whichever starting point has the nearest edge, we can start our search from there.
 *
 *  When searching within nodes, we will want to consider reserved spaces next to
 *  each other as a single reserved space during the first pass on node-search
 *  (so we can logarithmically reduce the search space when nodes often touch each other).
 *
 *  To do this, each node will maintain a higherReserved and higherUnreserved pointers;
 *  by searching for "the closest end of the next unreserved space",
 *  we can skip all adjacent reserved spaces, while still being able to maintain
 *  a generalized linked list structure.
 *
 *  This collection will allow you to iterate elements in ascending or descending order,
 *  as well as by insertion order (when insertion order corresponds to priority,
 *  and when your calling code adapts to space reservation failures by shrinking
 *  or moving the reservation request, it becomes important to request space
 *  in the correct order).
