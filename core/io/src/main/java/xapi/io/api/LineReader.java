 * When text is delivered, new lines should be stripped; if you wish to preserve newlines,
 * you must put them back yourself.
 *
 * Some implementations, like {@link StringReader} support methods to block
 * on a given reader, as a handy means to wait until some other process has completed
 * (see {@link StringReader#waitToEnd()}).
