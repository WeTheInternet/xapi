  /**
   * This method is mostly for gwt; but is also useful for web apps and codegen
   *
   * Gwt dev mode has problems as its isolated classloader doesn't provide packages.
   * We can get class metadata directly using the thread classloader,
   * but the instances will throw class cast when trying to use constructors.
   * Classes returned by magicClass in devmode will be fully functional in terms
   * of reflection, but some data, like package, are stripped.
   *
   * It can also be used in gwt-prod to load class data that you do not want
   * compiled into the javascript; it will request the binary class data,
   * and parse out the metadata
   *
   * It can also be used in multi-classloader web app environments,
   * to perform class metadata introspection on objects from foreign classloaders.
   *
   * the extra support needed for gwt-dev is extracted here.
