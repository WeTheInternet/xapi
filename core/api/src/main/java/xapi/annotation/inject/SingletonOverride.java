/**
 * An annotation used to override a {@link SingletonDefault} used in dependency injection.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * When the {@link xapi.inject.X_Inject} generator processes classes, it chooses a single injection target
 * based on priority.  SingletonDefault is always the lowest priority;
 * OverrideImpls are chosen based on highest {@link #priority()}.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * The {@link #platform()} parameter currently only differentiates between gwt and pure java;
 * A service marked with {@link PlatformType#All} will be injected into all builds,
 * those marked with {@link PlatformType#GwtAll} will be in both dev mode and compiled gwt.
 * {@link PlatformType#GwtScript} is for compiled / super dev mode.
 * {@link PlatformType#GwtScript} is for dev mode only.
 * Use {@link PlatformType#Java} to include a class in META-INF/singletons, but exclude from Gwt.
 *
 * <br/><br/>
 *
 * The other platform types will be implemented as needed to support the full PlayN stack.
